# Product Requirements Document: Multi-Agent Health Insight System

## Executive Summary

The Multi-Agent Health Insight System is an AI-powered health analysis platform that leverages Anthropic's proven orchestrator-worker pattern to deliver comprehensive medical insights. By coordinating multiple specialized AI agents—each representing a different medical specialty—the system provides users with the same depth of analysis they would receive from consulting an entire medical team. This approach has demonstrated a 90.2% performance improvement over single-agent systems in complex analysis tasks.

The system transforms how individuals interact with their health data by providing natural language access to sophisticated medical analysis, real-time visualization of health trends, and actionable insights that would typically require multiple specialist consultations. Through an intuitive 3-panel interface, users can ask questions ranging from simple data retrieval to complex multi-domain health correlations, receiving responses synthesized from relevant medical specialists.

## Problem Statement

Healthcare consumers face significant challenges in understanding their health data:
- **Fragmented Information**: Lab results, medications, and vital signs exist in silos without meaningful connections
- **Complex Medical Language**: Test results use technical terminology that requires medical expertise to interpret
- **Limited Access to Specialists**: Getting comprehensive analysis requires multiple appointments with different specialists
- **Lack of Trend Analysis**: Historical health data rarely gets analyzed for patterns or early warning signs
- **Missed Correlations**: Important relationships between different health markers often go unnoticed

Current solutions either provide basic data storage without analysis or offer generic health advice without personalization. Users need a system that can provide specialist-level medical insights while remaining accessible and actionable.

3. **Comprehensive Synthesis**: The CMO synthesizes findings into cohesive, actionable insights
4. **Dynamic Visualization**: Interactive charts and graphs make complex data accessible
5. **Real-Time Progress Updates**: Users see which specialists are working and their findings in real-time
