# Product Requirements Document: Multi-Agent Health Insight System

## Executive Summary

The Multi-Agent Health Insight System revolutionizes personal health data analysis by employing an AI-powered medical team that works collaboratively to provide comprehensive health insights. Based on Anthropic's proven multi-agent architecture pattern, the system orchestrates specialized medical AI agents to analyze complex health data, delivering insights that would typically require consulting multiple medical specialists.

The system transforms how individuals understand their health by providing real-time, expert-level analysis of their medical data through natural language queries. By leveraging parallel agent execution and domain-specific expertise, users receive thorough, nuanced health insights that consider multiple medical perspectives simultaneously.

## Problem Statement

Healthcare consumers face significant challenges in understanding their health data:
- Medical test results are complex and require expert interpretation
- Different aspects of health are interconnected but typically analyzed in isolation
- Accessing multiple medical specialists for comprehensive analysis is time-consuming and expensive
- Trend analysis and correlation detection across different health metrics requires expertise
- Medication impacts and adherence patterns are difficult to track and understand

Current solutions provide fragmented views of health data without the comprehensive, multi-perspective analysis that medical professionals would provide. Users need a system that can synthesize insights across multiple medical domains while maintaining clinical accuracy and accessibility.

## Solution Overview

The Multi-Agent Health Insight System implements an orchestrator-worker pattern where a Chief Medical Officer (CMO) agent coordinates a team of specialized medical agents to analyze health data comprehensively. The system provides:

1. **Intelligent Query Routing**: The CMO analyzes each health query and assembles the appropriate team of specialists
2. **Parallel Specialist Analysis**: Multiple domain experts work simultaneously to analyze different aspects of health data
3. **Comprehensive Synthesis**: The CMO synthesizes findings from all specialists into actionable insights
4. **Dynamic Visualizations**: Interactive charts and graphs that make complex health data understandable
5. **Real-time Progress Updates**: Users see which specialists are working and their analysis progress
