# Product Requirements Document: Multi-Agent Health Insight System

## Executive Summary

The Multi-Agent Health Insight System is a demonstration/proof of concept that showcases advanced AI orchestration patterns for healthcare analytics. Based on Anthropic's multi-agent research showing 90.2% performance improvements over single agents, this system uses a Chief Medical Officer (CMO) orchestrator to coordinate specialized medical AI agents that analyze health data and provide comprehensive insights.

This POC demonstrates how multi-agent systems can transform complex health data analysis by providing users with insights that would typically require consulting multiple medical specialists. The system features real-time streaming updates, beautiful medical visualizations, and an intuitive chat interface.

## Problem Statement

Healthcare consumers struggle to understand their health data holistically. Lab results, medications, vital signs, and medical history exist in silos, making it difficult to:
- Identify patterns and correlations across different health metrics
- Understand how medications affect lab results
- Receive comprehensive health assessments that consider all available data
- Get specialized medical perspectives without visiting multiple doctors

Current solutions either provide basic data visualization without insights or require users to manually connect information across different health domains.

## Target Users

### Primary Persona: Health-Conscious Individual
- **Demographics**: Adults aged 25-65 with chronic conditions or preventive health focus
- **Needs**: Comprehensive understanding of their health data, trend analysis, medication impact assessment
- **Goals**: Make informed health decisions, track progress, identify risks early
- **Pain Points**: Fragmented health data, lack of specialized insights, difficulty interpreting complex medical information

### Secondary Persona: Healthcare Provider
- **Demographics**: Primary care physicians, specialists, health coaches
- **Needs**: Comprehensive patient data analysis, multi-domain correlation insights
- **Goals**: Provide better patient care, identify overlooked health patterns
- **Pain Points**: Time constraints, siloed medical records, manual data correlation

## Solution Overview

The Multi-Agent Health Insight System employs an orchestrator-worker pattern where:
1. A Chief Medical Officer (CMO) agent analyzes query complexity and orchestrates specialists
2. Medical specialist agents (Cardiology, Endocrinology, etc.) perform deep domain analysis
3. Results are synthesized and presented with dynamic visualizations
4. Real-time streaming shows the medical team's analysis progress

The system adapts its response based on query complexity, activating more specialists for complex questions while providing quick answers for simple queries.
