# Feature Prioritization Matrix: Multi-Agent Health Insight System

## Prioritization Framework

Features are evaluated based on:
- **User Impact**: How much value does this deliver to users? (High/Medium/Low)
- **Development Effort**: How complex is this to build? (High/Medium/Low)
- **Priority Level**: P0 (MVP Critical), P1 (Important), P2 (Nice to Have)
- **Dependencies**: What must be built first?

## Priority Definitions

- **P0 (MVP Critical)**: Core functionality required for launch
- **P1 (Important)**: Significant value add, implement post-MVP
- **P2 (Nice to Have)**: Enhances experience but not critical
