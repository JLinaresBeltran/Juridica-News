# Feature Priority Matrix - Health Insight Assistant

## Prioritization Framework

Features are evaluated across four dimensions:
- **User Value**: Direct benefit to health outcomes (1-10)
- **Technical Complexity**: Development effort required (1-10, inverse)
- **Risk Mitigation**: Reduces medical/technical risks (1-10)
- **Differentiation**: Competitive advantage (1-10)

**Priority Score** = (User Value Ã— 2) + Risk Mitigation + Differentiation - Technical Complexity
