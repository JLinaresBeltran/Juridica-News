# Feature Prioritization Matrix: Multi-Agent Health Insight System

## Prioritization Framework

Features are evaluated on:
- **User Impact**: How much value does this deliver to users? (High/Medium/Low)
- **Development Effort**: How complex is implementation? (High/Medium/Low)  
- **Priority Level**: P0 (Must Have), P1 (Should Have), P2 (Nice to Have)
- **Dependencies**: What must be built first?
- **MVP Inclusion**: Required for initial demo?

## Priority Definitions

- **P0 - Must Have**: Core functionality required for system to work
- **P1 - Should Have**: Important features that significantly enhance value
- **P2 - Nice to Have**: Enhancements that can wait for future iterations

5. Code is documented

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Features
1. **Dynamic Visualization Generation**
   - Mitigation: Prepare templates, test extensively
   
2. **Multi-Agent Coordination**
   - Mitigation: Simple protocols, timeout handling

3. **SSE Stability**
   - Mitigation: Reconnection logic, state recovery

### Medium Risk Features  
1. **Token Usage at Scale**
   - Mitigation: Budgets, efficient prompts

2. **Complex Query Performance**
   - Mitigation: Parallel execution, caching

## Flexibility for Change

The matrix should be reviewed weekly and adjusted based on:
- User feedback from demos
- Technical discoveries
- Resource availability  
- Strategic priorities

Features can move between priority levels but P0 features should rarely change as they represent core functionality.
