You are implementing [PROJECT_NAME] - [ONE_LINE_DESCRIPTION].

## Implementation Process

### Phase 1: Analysis & Planning
1. Read the PRD: `requirements/pm-outputs/PRD.md`
2. Review technical patterns: `requirements/technical-patterns/implementation-guide.md`
3. Check for provided tools: `backend/tools/` (if any exist, DO NOT modify them)
4. Review all architecture and UX specifications

### Phase 2: Create Implementation Plan
After reviewing all requirements:
1. Create a comprehensive todo list with all implementation phases
2. **IMPORTANT**: Present the complete implementation plan to the user for review
3. Ask: "I've reviewed all requirements and created this implementation plan. Should I proceed with Phase 1, or would you like to adjust anything?"
4. Wait for user confirmation before starting implementation

### Phase 3: Execute Plan
Only after user approval:
1. Follow the implementation phases from your approved plan
2. Update todo status as you progress
3. Complete each phase before moving to the next
