# CLAUDE.md

Welcome to the **3 AI Amigos** workspace - a complete toolkit for orchestrating AI-powered Product Managers, UX Designers, and Claude Code to build production systems.

## 🎯 What You're Looking At

This repository contains everything needed to implement the 3 AI Amigos methodology:
- **Agent configurations** to create your AI team
- **Technical patterns** that work for any domain  
- **Complete example** of a multi-agent health system
- **Setup guides** to get you started

## 🚀 Quick Navigation

## 💡 The Big Picture

The 3 AI Amigos transforms development by orchestrating:

1. **Product Manager Agent** → Creates requirements & architecture
2. **UX Designer Agent** → Designs interfaces & experiences
3. **Claude Code** → Implements the complete system

You provide domain expertise, they build the system.

## 🎯 Your Next Steps

### Option 1: Build Something
1. Read **README.md** thoroughly
2. Set up your 3 AI agents using files in `agents/*/config/`
3. Create domain documents (use health example as template)
4. Run through the 5-phase process
5. Get a working system!

### Option 2: Explore First
1. Look at `docs/images/ai-amigos-diagram.png`
2. Browse the health example in `use-cases/`
3. Read technical guides to understand patterns
4. Then follow Option 1 when ready

## 🔑 Key Files You'll Need

### To Configure Agents:
- `agents/pm-agent/config/pm-agent-description.md`
- `agents/pm-agent/config/pm-agent-instructions.md`
- `agents/ux-agent/config/ux-agent-description.md`
- `agents/ux-agent/config/ux-designer-agent-instructions.md`  
- `agents/code-agent/config/minimal-claude-md-template.md`

### To Understand What to Submit:
- `agents/pm-agent/example-prompts/po-prompt-for-pm-agent.md`
- `agents/ux-agent/example-prompts/po-prompt-for-ux-agent.md`

### To See What Documents You Need:
- `docs/po-document-checklist.md`
- `use-cases/multi-agent-health-insight-system/` (examples)

## 📝 Important Notes

1. **Domain-Agnostic vs Domain-Specific**
   - `agents/` and `technical-guides/` work for ANY domain
   - `use-cases/` shows specific examples
   - Keep them separate!

2. **The Process is Sequential**
   - PM Agent first → UX Agent second → Claude Code last
   - Each builds on the previous outputs

3. **You're the Product Owner**
   - You provide domain knowledge
   - You guide the agents
   - You validate outputs

## 🎉 Success Looks Like

- ✅ 3 AI agents configured in Claude Desktop
- ✅ Your domain requirements ready
- ✅ PM creates comprehensive specs
- ✅ UX creates beautiful designs
- ✅ Claude Code builds working system
- ✅ System runs successfully!
